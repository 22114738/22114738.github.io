		<h1>Cloud Engineer</h1>
                  

		<p>What is a cloud engineer?
A cloud engineer is an IT professional responsible for any technological duties associated with cloud computing, including design, planning, management, maintenance and support.

Cloud engineer is a general term encompassing a few different roles, including:

cloud architect
cloud software engineer
cloud security engineer
cloud systems engineer
cloud network engineer
Each position focuses on a specific type of cloud computing, rather than the technology as a whole. Companies that hire cloud engineers are often looking to deploy cloud services, scale up their use of cloud resources or further their cloud understanding and technology.

Must-have skills for a cloud engineer
Cloud engineers in all roles must have proficiency in the following areas:

Linux. Cloud engineers should have a strong understanding of the Linux operating system, which companies frequently use for cloud development. Cloud engineers should understand the architecture, maintenance and administration of Linux servers.
Database skills. Cloud engineers should have cloud database management skills and knowledge of MySQL and Hadoop.
Programming. Cloud engineers should have strong general programming skills, along with knowledge of programming languages such as SQL, Java, Python, Ruby, Golang, PHP and .NET.
Networking. Cloud engineers should understand virtual networks and general network management functions.
DevOps. DevOps is a popular framework for cloud engineering, so having a hands-on understanding of DevOps practices can be valuable to employers. Amazon Web Services (AWS) DevOps in particular is a sought-after skill by cloud providers.
Containerization. Cloud engineers should have proficiency of containerization tools and understand Docker and Kubernetes.
Virtualization. Cloud engineers should have the knowledge to deploy and run application software on virtual machines.
Understanding of cloud providers. As technical cloud features and engineering practices can vary between different service providers, understanding what each offers can enhance a cloud engineer's knowledge and make them more marketable to employers.
Security and recovery. Cloud security is a growing priority among providers and knowledge of cybersecurity in the context of the cloud is a valuable asset.
Web services and application programming interfaces (APIs). Cloud engineers should have knowledge of open standards, such as XML (Extensible Markup Language), SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), WSDL (Web Services Description Language) and UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration), and an understanding of how APIs are engineered.</p>
